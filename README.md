# NugetCompare
Nuget package compare tool.

This project came out of an issue where a solution grew to have several projects and all with many nuget dependencies.
There lacked a clear path to view all of the dependencies and easily identify version differences.

This little project is set out to display all nuget packages and identify the issues which may exist with version references between projects.

WIP!
